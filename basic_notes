React
npx create-react-app <app_name>
Yarn was created by facebook when npm was having some issues

babel and webpack for browser compatibility  -- take our src folder, babel is going to make sure it runs on very browser(similarly like jQuery) 
webpack bundles up everything together and minify the code
npm run build -- optimised code build

class App extends Component{
}

classes vs function

JSX attribute

Component is a property on react.

Lifecycle methods - called at different stages when the page is rendered.

state vs props


Github
create a new repository
copy the ssh link
git remote add origin <link> 
yarn add gh-pages

in package.json; add "homepage": "https://gunjangaur.github.io/monsters-rolodex",

in scripts
"predeploy":"yarn build",
"deploy":"gh-pages -d build"


git remote set-url origin https://gunjangaur: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@github.com/gunjangaur/monsters-rolodex.git

create-react-app 


unidirectional data flow


state update are asynchronous

this.setState({},()=>{})
object and callback method are passed

alternate class syntax

react lifecycle methods
constructor()
componentDidMount()
componentDidUpdate()
componentWillUnmount()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()

When mounting
constructor()-loads all the methods and functionality from the Component via super() call, state is initialized here so it can be available to all other methods
render() -- display part, any props value gets evaluated here
componentDidMount()


Updating
new props , setState(), forceUpdate()
after the above changes, shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
componentDidUpdate()

Unmounting 
when the component is already mouted but due to some condition it has to be unmounted such as toggling
before removing it will call componentWillUnmount
